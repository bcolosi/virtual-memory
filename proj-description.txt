FIFO Description:

FIFO replacement is a very simple algorithm.  We maintain an array with as many entries
as possible frames. The array type is a custom struct that holds the frame number and a dirty
bool.  When the policy is initiated, reads and writes are protected on the entire block of
memory.  Upon attempting to access a restricted block, the fifo_handler funtion is called.
If the faulting page is not present in memroy, the handler evicts the oldest page
(the first one in the array) and adds the new page to the array. Read permissions are
enabled on all new adds.  If a page faults that is in memory, we assume a write fault
and add write permission to the page.

Clock Replacement Description:


We assume only reads and writes to the memory, no execute calls. (This is
probably a fine assumption )
