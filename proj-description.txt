FIFO Description:

FIFO replacement is a very simple algorithm.  We maintain an array with as many entries
as possible frames. The array type is a custom struct that holds the frame number and a dirty
bool.  When the policy is initiated, reads and writes are protected on the entire block of
memory.  Upon attempting to access a restricted block, the fifo_handler funtion is called.
If the faulting page is not present in memroy, the handler evicts the oldest page
(the first one in the array) and adds the new page to the array and the number of faults is
incremented.  Read permissions are enabled on all new adds.  If a page that is in memory faults,
we assume a write fault and add write permission to the page as well as
setting the dirty field. When a page with a non-zero dirty field is evicted,
the write_back counter is incremented.

Clock Replacement Description:


We assume only reads and writes to the memory, no execute calls. (This is
probably a fine assumption )
